# FLUTTER & DART CHEATSHEET

## What FLUTTER is? 
-------------------
     Understanding FLUTTER ARCHITECTURE
    ---------------------------------------
        *   UI as Code: Build App from a Widget Tree
            *   No Drag & Drop
            *   No Visual Editor
            *   Code Only
            *   Extremely straightforward
    
        *   Embrace Platform Differences
        *   One Codebase
            *   Bundle of dart files

    How is Flutter & Dart "transformed" to a Native App?
    --------------------------------------------------------
    * Dart Code uses Flutter API Utilites and Widgets to build your own widgets and code. Then, compiles the code into both Native Apple and Native Android code
    * Flutter does not use Platform Primitives
    * It does not compile to Apple or Android Code
    * FLUTTER CODE CUSTOM COMPILES Custom implementation
    * Flutter directly controls every pixel which is drawn
    * Has greater control, less platform-limitations/ "no translation loss"

## FLUTTER VERSIONS
---------------------
    * Versions change frequently
    * Bugfixes
    * small improvements
    * "behind the scenes" changes
    * New (niche) features

        D) IN TERMINAL: Type "flutter devices" to verify Flutter recognizes your connect device

    SETUP ANDROID EMULATOR
    ----------------------

        1) Enable VM acceleration   https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration
        2) Launch Android Studio and go to AVD Manager/Create Virtual Device..
        3) Choose a device
        4) Select system image for the Android versions you want to emulate
        5) Under Emulated Performances, select **Hardware - GLES 2.0** 
        6) VERIFY AVD configuration, click FINISH

FLUTTER: BASICS
------------------------
    
    CREATE a NEW project
    ====================
    1) In desired root directory in terminal: 
        type "flutter create <projectName> 
        * project names can only have underscores & lowercase letters
    1) CD into project
    2) Start the emulator either through Android Studio/AVD Manager or 
    3) Start the Project in the emulator
        A) RUN EMULATOR 
        B)IN TERMINAL: run "flutter run"
        C) OR START EDITOR DEBUG
    4) PUT ALL YOUR .dart files in LIB directory
